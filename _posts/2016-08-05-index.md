**About**

**Piduino Library (libpiduino)** is a C++ library that lets you write and compile Arduino programs for the Raspberry Pi. This library 
targets the BCM283x SoC, all 54 pins, and not a specific set of pins of any Raspberry Pi (RPi) board.

This library **does not support Analog to Digital Conversion (ADC)** functions as the BCM283x
SoC does not have an integrated ADC and we don't want to create hardware-dependant software. 
If you need ADC is recomended to use external libraries.

Finally most of this library code was built so it can be easily ported to other plataforms like the Artik/Exynos SoCs
 or Snapdragon SoCs in the future, if you want to port this library to other plataforms send me an email.

**Install**

Open a terminal in your Raspberry Pi board and enter:

```
sudo apt-get install TODO
```

**Setup**

To run this library correctly first setup the SPI, I2C and Serial Interfaces. To do this type:

```
sudo raspi-config
```

Go to Advanced options.

![rpi-advanced-options](images/rpi_config_1.png){:class="center-image"}

Enable SPI and I2C Interfaces and disable Serial login shell.

![rpi-enable-interfaces](images/rpi_config_2.png){:class="center-image"}

* Enable SPI Interface: &nbsp;&nbsp; YES -> OK -> YES -> OK
* Enable I2C Interface: &nbsp;&nbsp; YES -> OK -> YES -> OK
* Dsiable Serial login shell: &nbsp;&nbsp; NO -> OK

Reboot your system. 

**Run**

Once the setup is complete create a file, lets say test.cpp, and copy the following code:

test.cpp

{% highlight c %}
#include <Arduino.h>

int ledPin = 4; // GPIO4

void setup() {
        pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
        printf("LED ON\n");
        digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);
        delay(1000);
        printf("LED OFF\n");
        digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);
        delay(1000);
}
{% endhighlight %}

Compile it.

```
g++ -lpiduino test.cpp -o test
```

Now connect an LED with its proper resistor (e.g. 220 ohms) to RPi GPIO4.
See which pin is GPIO4 in your board in the [RPi Pinout]({{ site.baseurl }}/RPi_Pinout.html) tab.

![LED-Example](images/LED_Example.png){:class="center-image"}

Run your program. 

```
./test
```

Enjoy!!.

See the [Reference]({{ site.baseurl }}/Reference.html) tab to see all the functions ported.

-----------------

**Optional**

If you want to compile an .ino file you can do it like below and use either g++ or gcc.

```
g++ -lpiduino -x c++ test.ino -o test 
```

If you want to include main() in your code you can call "piDuino.h". piDuino.h has already all the headers of the Piduino library included so you don't need to type Wire.h or SPI.h like as if you use Arduino.h.

{% highlight c %}
#include "piDuino.h"

int ledPin = 4; // GPIO4

void setup() {
        pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
        printf("LED ON\n");
        digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);
        delay(1000);
        printf("LED OFF\n");
        digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);
        delay(1000);
}

int main () {
	setup();
	while(1){
		loop();
	}
	return (0);
}
{% endhighlight %}

If you want to check that the SPI, I2C drivers are enabled use the command below.
Note that the I2C number may be diferent depending on your RPi board version. 

```
ls /dev/ | grep 'i2c-\|spidev\|ttyAMA0'
```

The outupt should be something like this:

```
i2c-1
spidev0.0
spidev0.1
ttyAMA0
```

Thank you!.
