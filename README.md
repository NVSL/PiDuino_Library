# PiDuino_Library

PiDuino Library is a C++ library that lets you write programs for Raspberry Pi as if you were writing an Arduino program. 

This library **does not allow you to change hadrware peripheral intefaces (e.g change I2C pins for GPIO pins)** in real time as this library relays on the I2C, SPI, TTY(Serial) and GPIO linux drivers to interface with the pins I/Os. 

This library also **does not support Analog to Digital Conversion (or ADC)** functions as the Raspberry Pi hardware does not have an integrated ADC and we donÂ´t want to create hardware dependant code. If you need ADC is recomended to use external libraries. 

## Implemented Arduino Functions and Libraries
PiDuino Library aims to support the most basic official Arduino functions published in the [Arduino official website] (https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/Libraries) as of April 2016. Note that Arduino API have many legacy functions that although keeped no longer used, the ported libraries and functions are only the ones published in the official website.

**Implemented Arduino Functions :**
Digital I/O, Analog I/O, Advanced I/O, Time, Math, Trigonometry, Random Numbers, Bits and Bytes, External Interrupts, Interrupts, Communication

**Implemented Arduino Libraries :**
Serial, Wire, SPI

**Notes:**
* Data Type String - object:
will not be implemented in the first release. 
* **B** for binary representation (e.g B10100001) conflicts with some termios.h definitions so use **0b** instead.

---------------------------------------------------

## TODO'S

* Make a SPI and I2C begin("/dev/i2c-x") to let developers choose any i2c-x number. 
* Check Linux i2c-slave. 
* Maybe only add B(8 bits) only and that way prevent conflicts with termios.h
* Defintily separate files and make it C compatible (At the end)
* Make an Arduino.h header containing piDuino.h so developers don't need to change too much code. 
* Add arduino String object.
* Maybe add a SPISettings(..., bitsPerWord, CS(High?low)) and their bit routines config. to SPI. For bitPerWord transfer len will need to be multiplied by (bitsPerWord/8)
